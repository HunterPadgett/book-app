## Description

ShelfSpace is a web app that lets you keep track of the books you've read. You can search for books using the Open Library API, add them to your reading list, and it will give you the date that you added the book along with an image of the book cover. Your reading list is saved to your browser's local storage, so you can come back to it later and see your progress.

The app is built with Astro, a modern static site builder for the modern web. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interacting with the Open Library API and managing local storage.
